# hops install

Install a formula

## Synopsis

Install a formula. Additional options specific to a formula may be appended to the command.

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK is set, brew upgrade or brew
reinstall will be run for outdated dependents and dependents with broken
linkage, respectively.

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP is set, brew cleanup will then be run for
the installed formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_UPGRADE is set, brew install formula will
upgrade formula if it is already installed but outdated.
